    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In 1996 I ended my university studies and started working for ABB as a Lotus Notes administrator. 
        I have since then worked with delivering IT services in more or less every possible aspect, having 
        leading roles in different degrees.<br/><br/>
        It is my firm belief that the key to success in any service oriented business is people. With 
        motivated employees and customers with the right expectations it is possible to take a service 
        oriented business anywhere. The critical success factor to creating these prerequisites is the 
        ability to build relations. I excel at building relations. I am truly a people person. <br/><br/>
        When it comes to solving problems my experiences have taught me that a pragmatic approach always
         is efficient. I am allergic to finger pointing and blame games since neither of them really helps 
         finding a solution to any problem.<br/><br/>
        In the world of IT services everything is connected to everything in some way. In this environment 
        it is important to be able to see the full picture and how things are related. This is one of my 
        greatest strengths. I am holistic, systematic and analytical in the way I approach any task. I 
        have found that these properties make good use in situations of change. It is also in situations of 
        change I thrive and perform at my best.</p>
    <p>As you can see on this website, web development is not my greatest strength. My skills are best
        used in agile leadership roles, such as scrum master or porduct owner. But I beleive that 
        cheating a bit as a developer make me stronger in my core skillset.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>The majority of my academic studies has been within the area business administration. However, I have 
        not worked a singel day within this field. Instead my worklife has been focused on IT. Of course, 
        there have been some studies in the IT area as well. If you want to find out more, you will find a 
        list of the educations I have done here: <a href="./Public/education.html">List of educations</a>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>After I finished my university studies in business administration, I got my first real job as a Lotus 
        Notes administrator. This was the start of a career in IT that has taken me through most or of the areas
        within the business. I have never worked with network or client computors, but with those two expectations
        it is a "you name I have worked with it"-situation. A list of my employments and roles can be found 
        here: <a href="./Public/experience.html">List of work experience</a>
